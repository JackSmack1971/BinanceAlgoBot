# Architectural Documentation Plan

This document outlines the plan for creating architectural documentation for the project.

## 1. Architecture Diagrams

*   **Component Diagram:** This diagram will show the main components of the system and their relationships. The components will include:
    *   `main.py`
    *   `TradingOrchestrator`
    *   `Backtester`
    *   `StrategyFactory`
    *   `Strategy` (and its implementations, e.g., `BTCStrategy`)
    *   `ExchangeInterface`
    *   `Binance Client`
    *   `PositionManager`
    *   `RiskManagement`
    *   `DataFeed`
    *   `PerformanceAnalyzer`
    *   `ReportGenerator`
    *   `VisualizationService`
    *   `Database` (and its repositories)
*   **Data Flow Diagram:** This diagram will illustrate the flow of data during a backtest. It will show how historical data is fetched, processed, and used to generate trading signals.
*   **Deployment Diagram:** This diagram will show the deployment environment of the system, including the Binance API, the database, and the trading bot application.
*   **Sequence Diagrams:**
    *   Live trading cycle
    *   Backtest execution
    *   Strategy switching process
*   **Entity-Relationship Diagram:** This diagram will illustrate the database schema, including tables, columns, and relationships.

I will use PlantUML to create these diagrams. I will specify the PlantUML diagram types (e.g., class diagram, sequence diagram) in the documentation.

## 2. Component Interface Specifications

I will document the interfaces of the following key components:

*   `Strategy`: This will include the abstract methods `calculate_indicators()`, `run()`, `open_position()`, and `close_position()`.
*   `ExchangeInterface`: This will include the abstract methods `fetch_market_data()`, `place_order()`, `get_account_balance()`, and `get_order_status()`.
*   `PositionManager`: This will include methods for calculating position size, opening positions, closing positions, and managing risk.
*   `RiskManagement`: This will include methods for calculating risk and managing position sizing based on volatility.

For each interface, I will provide a brief description of its purpose, the parameters it accepts, and the values it returns.

## 3. Data Flow Documentation

I will provide a detailed description of the data flow during a backtest. This will include:

*   Fetching historical data from the Binance API.
*   Transforming the data into a Pandas DataFrame.
*   Calculating technical indicators.
*   Generating trading signals based on the strategy.
*   Tracking positions.
*   Analyzing performance.
*   Generating reports and visualizations.

## 4. Database Schema Documentation

I will create an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to document the database schema. This will include:

*   Tables: `risk_parameters`, `strategies`, etc.
*   Columns: Data types, primary keys, foreign keys, constraints.
*   Relationships: How tables relate to each other.

## 5. Configuration Management Documentation

I will document how configuration parameters flow through the system, including:

*   Configuration files: `config.json`, `config.py`
*   Configuration service: `configuration_service.py`
*   How parameters are loaded, accessed, and used by different components.

## 6. Error Handling Strategy Documentation

I will document the system's approach to error handling, including:

*   The `handle_error` decorator in `utils.py`.
*   How errors are logged, handled, and propagated.
*   Error handling best practices used in the project.

I will store all the documentation in the `docs` directory. I will create a `README.md` file in the `docs` directory that provides an overview of the documentation and instructions on how to view the diagrams.
